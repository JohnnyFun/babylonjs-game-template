- Animations
  - smooth transitions
  - best practices
    - performance considerations
  - character design and rigging (https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/animation/animatedCharacter)
    - see if their rigging tool is faster than blender?
- Input
  - smooth controls 
    - 3rd person
    - VR with joy stick
- Materials
  - how to wrap meshes well with materials (color and texture)
  - blending multiple to get cool textured colored effect
  - get better idea when to use blender vs babylonjs
  - how to pack meshes and textures in glb files to load into games
    - separately?
- Mesh
  - Mesh Transformations
    - sequencing rotations
    - rotation quaternions
  - Interactions
    - Mesh intersections
- Particles
  - smoke, water droplets, fire, etc.
- Blender to babylonjs exporter!
  - https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Exporters/Blender
    - spits out html file to view in babylonjs

- Game ideas
  - maze boy (make work outside of VR too)
    - generate mazes from json file
      - json file should be x,y coordinates to make lines and then extrude them upward!
      - make editor to draw a maze and then go play it!
      - save maze to local storage so can re-visit past ones!
    - 3rd person character
      - just start out with "dude" or cat since they have nice smooth walking animations
      - hook up to wasd and arrow keys with smooth rotation like in "simple-game" thing
      - hook up collisions with the maze mesh so can't walk through the walls
    - put your fountain in next to the exit! and your bunny!! and a dick statue!!
  - VR
    - spacecraft flyer
      - make cool spacecraft interior to sit in
      - have a steering yoke to grab and turn to guide ship around asteroids
    - tank turret and/or machine gun
      - joy stick to drive tank
      - other joy stick to turn turret separately
      - squeeze triggers near machine gun to take hold of it
        - right trigger to shoot it
      - left trigger to shoot main gun
