- rubik's cube
  - animate it, send actions to control it
  - learn to beat it with reinforcement algorithm

- space ship cockpit game
  - travel through boulder field and avoid hitting shit
  - game play
    - VR view from inside cockpit, but make it work outside VR too with keyboard controls
    - game loads, incoming mission..."Hey...can you bring the spaceship over here? Try not to hit anything on the way over though. It's...pretty expensive. Also watch your fuel level--it's pretty low and if you run out of fuel...yeah, just don't run out of fuel."
    - if hit anything, FAIL: "Dude. I told you not to hit anything. Then you hit something."
    - if run out of fuel, FAIL: "Why aren't you moving anymore...oh...did you run out of fuel? [disgusted sigh...] Son of a...ok"
  - design notes
    - be able to see clearly that you're in a big fucking spaceship from inside the cockpit
    - make ship as simple as possible--focus on game dynamics initially, THEN add details/textures/bumpmaps/lighting/etc to make it look cooler
  - spaceship interior notes  
    - nice-to-have: show speed in x,y,z directions
    - nice-to-have: grab the yoke in VR. push forward, nose down. pull back, nose up. turn left, rotate on z left. turn right...
                    right trigger throttle
                      throttle does an impulse to move the ship like in dirtball (and how a thrust would actually work)
                      no gravity vector
                    alerons too to tilt down/up in a turn

  - environment
    - space rocks that you need to avoid
      - add physics collisions (simple box imposters for rocks and spaceship)
    - skybox of starts and maybe a nearby planet

- Tractor
  - make it steer and follow the path of its tires. put yourself in cab, make it VR!
    - same general premise could be done for spaceship cockpit!

- Make the wand character that Tim made a while back
  - shape and hair
  - then animate it with mixamo to walk and jump (could just show videos of it animating on mixamo, dancing, running, etc)
  
- AR
  - use the real world as your game arena!!
  - run through the forest on mountains in real life shooting zombies!
  - productivity HUD-type stuff
    - show heart rate or just time of day
- Animations
  - smooth transitions
  - best practices
    - performance considerations
  - character design and rigging (https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/animation/animatedCharacter)
    - see if their rigging tool is faster than blender?
- Input
  - smooth controls 
    - 3rd person
    - VR with joy stick
- Materials
  - how to wrap meshes well with materials (color and texture)
  - blending multiple to get cool textured colored effect
  - get better idea when to use blender vs babylonjs
  - how to pack meshes and textures in glb files to load into games
    - separately?
- Mesh
  - Mesh Transformations
    - sequencing rotations
    - rotation quaternions
  - Interactions
    - Mesh intersections
- Particles
  - smoke, water droplets, fire, etc.
- Blender to babylonjs exporter!
  - https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Exporters/Blender
    - spits out html file to view in babylonjs

- Game ideas
  - maze boy (make work outside of VR too)
    - generate mazes from json file
      - json file should be x,y coordinates to make lines and then extrude them upward!
      - make editor to draw a maze and then go play it!
      - save maze to local storage so can re-visit past ones!
    - 3rd person character
      - just start out with "dude" or cat since they have nice smooth walking animations
      - hook up to wasd and arrow keys with smooth rotation like in "simple-game" thing
      - hook up collisions with the maze mesh so can't walk through the walls
    - put your fountain in next to the exit! and your bunny!! and a dick statue!!
  - VR
    - spacecraft flyer
      - make cool spacecraft interior to sit in
      - have a steering yoke to grab and turn to guide ship around asteroids
    - tank turret and/or machine gun
      - joy stick to drive tank
      - other joy stick to turn turret separately
      - squeeze triggers near machine gun to take hold of it
        - right trigger to shoot it
      - left trigger to shoot main gun
